# 👋 Hi there, I'm Pablo Sebastián De Masi (sebademasi10)

### 👨‍💻 About Me

- **Senior Site Reliability Engineer** with a comprehensive background in Systems Analysis from [Universidad Tecnológica Nacional](https://utn.edu.ar).
- Passionate about:
  - **Linux** (I can quit anytime, I swear)
  - **Networking** (because packets are people too)
  - **Monitoring & Observability** (if you can’t measure it, it’s Schrödinger’s infrastructure)
  - **DevOps & CI/CD** (automation is my middle name)
  - **Software Engineering** & **Scripting** (CLIs over GUIs, always)
  - **AI Tools** (agents, context, MCP—machines may not take over, but they sure help)
- Advocate of **best practices**, automation, and “if it’s not in code, it doesn’t exist”.

---

### 🚀 What I Do

- Architect, build, and maintain reliable, scalable, and observable systems.
- Lead initiatives in **automation**, **containerization** (hello, Docker), and robust **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Craft and maintain CLI tools and scripts to make life (and deployments) easier.
- Use and experiment with the latest in **AI tools** to boost productivity and troubleshooting.

- Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, firewalls—if it routes, I know it)
- Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, you name it)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)
